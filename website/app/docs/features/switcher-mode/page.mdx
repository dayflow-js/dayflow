# View Switcher Modes

The `switcherMode` option controls how the header view switcher is rendered. The library ships with two modes tailored for different layouts:

- **`buttons`** – the default desktop friendly layout with a centered button group.
- **`select`** – condenses the switcher into a dropdown for mobile or compact toolbars.

Use the interactive sample below to compare both modes with identical data and configuration.

<SwitcherModeShowcase />

## Quick Start

```tsx copy
import { useCalendarApp, DayFlowCalendar, createMonthView } from '@dayflow/core';

const calendar = useCalendarApp({
  views: [createMonthView()],
  switcherMode: 'select',
});

<DayFlowCalendar calendar={calendar} />;
```

Flip `switcherMode` between `'buttons'` and `'select'` to preview the alternate experiences instantly.
