# Sidebar

Explore DayFlow's sidebar experience with live examples. The demos below demonstrate the built-in sidebar UI and a custom React implementation.

## Default sidebar

Enable `useSidebar` to get the ready-made layout with visibility toggles, calendar color swatches, and collapse controls.

<SidebarBasicsShowcase />

## Custom sidebar layout

Provide a `render` function to replace the sidebar with bespoke content — like team filters, analytics, or curated quick links — while still relying on the shared calendar state.

<SidebarCustomShowcase />

### What to explore

- Hide and show calendars to see the toggles update instantly.
- Drag events between views; the custom sidebar keeps upcoming highlights in sync.
- Collapse the sidebar to reclaim space when focusing on dense week views.
